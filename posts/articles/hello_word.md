## Hello dear rÃ©adders

First of all, thanks for reading my first article: I hope you enjoy my website so far!
As I'm currently writing my first article, I remember my first time at programation... my first *Hello Word* in `Javascript`.

```js
console.log("Hello Word")
```

Simple right ?
But, why do we use this sentence and not just `"Test"` like we all have done for debugging ?

### Let's start learning

#### The programation begining

Maybe you don't know, but before everything, programation is no more than a succetion of `0` and `1` that is no more than instruction for the computer components. Then, some great people invented a language made to have clearer and more understandable syntax (because yeah, coding with `0` and `1` isn't fun), and the [Assembly language](https://google.com/search?q=Assembly+language) was born.

> But, Johan: that's just the history of programation! We don't care about the assembly language, we want to know why do all good programers write "Hello Word" and not just "Test" ?

Hmm, yeah: I know. But to undertand where does this sentence come from, we need first to understand the start of programation.

Hey! Sorry but at this time I have not finished to write this article, maybe, if you come later you'll be able to read the entire article!

See you next time :)
