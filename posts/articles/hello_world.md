## Hello dear readders

First of all, thanks for reading my first article: I hope you enjoy my website so far!
As I'm currently writing my first article, I remember my first time at programation... my first *Hello World* in `Javascript`.

```js
console.log("Hello World")
```

Simple right ?
But, why do we use this sentence and not just `"Test"` like we all have done for debugging ?

## Let's start learning

### The programation begining

Maybe you don't know, but before everything, programation is no more than a succetion of `0` and `1` that is no more than instruction for the computer components. Then, some great people invented a language made to have clearer and more understandable syntax (because yeah, coding with `0` and `1` isn't fun), and the [Assembly language](https://google.com/search?q=Assembly+language) was born.

> But, Johan: that's just the history of programation! We don't care about the assembly language, we want to know why do all good programers write "Hello World" and not just "Test" ?

Hmm, yeah: I know. But to undertand where does this sentence come from, we need first to understand the start of programation.

### The begining of the hello World usage

While small test programs have existed since the beginning of programming, the tradition of using hello world as a test message was started by the book The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, published in 1978.

The first example in this book prints hello, world (without a capital letter or a period, but with a comma and a terminal newline). The first hello world that Kernighan and Ritchie remember came from a B language learning manual written by Kernighan. The 16-bit PDP-11 — one of the most popular computers of the time — helped spread the term, with users purchasing the book The C Programming Language to learn how to use the machine. In an interview with the Indian edition of Forbes magazine, Brian Kernighan explains that this phrase comes from a cartoon he had seen, where a chick came out of its egg saying "Hello, World!".

In the 21st century, programs more often display Hello, world! as a sentence, with capital letter, comma and final exclamation point.
